        The policy layer for dispatching jobs and validating parameters,

        Parameters
        ----------
        user
            User on behalf this operation is performed.
        job_id
            Identifier of the job.
        wait
            If given, wait up to this many seconds for the status to change
            before returning.  ``-1`` says to wait the maximum length of time.
            This is done by polling the database with exponential backoff.
            This will only be honored if the phase is ``PENDING``, ``QUEUED``,
            or ``EXECUTING``.
        wait_phase
            If ``wait`` was given, the starting phase for waiting.  Returns
            immediately if the initial phase doesn't match this one.
        wait_for_completion
            If set to true, wait until the job completes (has a phase other
            than ``QUEUED`` or ``EXECUTING``).  Only one of this or
            ``wait_phase`` should be given.  Ignored if ``wait`` was not
            given.

        Returns
        -------
        vocutouts.uws.models.Job
            The corresponding job.

        Raises
        ------
        vocutouts.uws.exceptions.PermissionDeniedError
            If the job ID doesn't exist or is for a user other than the
            provided user.

        Notes
        -----
        ``wait`` and related parameters are relatively inefficient since they
        poll the database using exponential backoff (starting at a 0.1s delay
        and increasing by 1.5x).  There doesn't seem to be a better solution
        without the added complexity of Dramatiq result storage and complex
        use of the Dramatiq message bus.  This may need to be reconsidered if
        it becomes a performance bottleneck.
