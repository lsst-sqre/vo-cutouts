class UWSPolicy(ABC):
    """Abstract interface for the application-provided policy layer.

    This class encapsulates functions to make policy decisions about UWS
    actions specific to a particular service.  Examples include dispatching
    work to a backend worker, validating parameters when the user attempts to
    change them after job creation, or deciding whether to accept a new
    execution duration or destruction time.

    Applications that use UWS should create an implementation of this abstract
    base class and then pass it into
    `~vocutouts.uws.dependencies.UWSDepencency` ``initialize`` method.

        ----------
