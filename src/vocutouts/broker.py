"""The global broker used by the image cutout service.

Loading this module defines a default Dramatiq broker used by both the API
frontend and the UWS database worker.  This module is **not** used by the
cutout implementation backend, which is a standalone Python module that
creates its own (compatible) broker.

This module must be loaded before any code using @dramatiq.actor is imported,
or those tasks will be associated with a RabbitMQ broker.
