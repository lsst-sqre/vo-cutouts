### New features

- Restore support for execution duration and change the default execution duration back to 10 minutes. Use a very ugly hack to enforce a timeout in the backend worker that will hopefully not be too fragile.
- Re-add the `CUTOUT_TIMEOUT` configuration option to change the default and maximum execution duration for cutout jobs.
