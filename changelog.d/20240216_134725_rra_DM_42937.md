### New features

- Add support for querying the Butler server rather than instantiating local Butler instances. To support this, vo-cutouts now requires delegated tokens from Gafaelfawr so that it can make API calls on behalf of the user.

### Other changes

- Add a change log maintained using [scriv](https://scriv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
