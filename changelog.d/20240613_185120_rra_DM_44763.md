### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Cancelling or aborting jobs is not supported by the combination of arq and sync worker functions. Properly reflect this in job metadata by forcing execution duration to 0 to indicate that no limit is applied. Substantially increase the default arq job timeout since the timeout will be ineffective anyway.
- Drop the `CUTOUT_TIMEOUT` configuration option since we have no way of enforcing a timeout on jobs.
