### Bug fixes

- Stop setting `isPost` when returning UWS parameters. This undocumented field is supposed to only be set if the parameter contains a raw POST value rather than a regular parameter, which is never the case here.

### Other changes

- Some XML output from UWS handlers is now handled by [vo-models](https://vo-models.readthedocs.io/latest/) instead of hand-written XML templates. More responses will hopefully be converted in the future.
