### New features

- Use Alembic to manage the schema of the UWS database. When upgrading to this version, set `config.updateSchema` to true in the Helm configuration for the first deployment. This release contains no schema changes, but needs to perform a migration to add the Alembic version information. The vo-cutouts components will now refuse to start if the database schema has changed and the database has not yet been migrated.
