### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Change the job queuing system from Dramatiq to [arq](https://arq-docs.helpmanual.io/). This change should be transparent to users when creating new jobs, but any in-progress jobs at the time of the upgrade will be orphaned.
- Use workload identity for all authentication when deployed on Google Cloud. Separate service account keys are no longer required or used. The `vo-cutouts` Google service account now requires the `storage.legacyBucketWriter` role in addition to `storage.objectViewer`.

### New features

- Add support for `gs` storage URLs in addition to `s3` storage URLs. When a `gs` storage URL is used, the image cutout backend will use the Google Cloud Storage Python API to store the results instead of boto, which will work correctly with workload identity.

### Bug fixes

- Queuing a job for execution in the frontend is now async and will not block the event loop, which may help with performance under load.
