### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Add new `CUTOUTMODE` parameter that can be set to `image`, `masked-image`, or `exposure`, where `exposure` provides the previous behavior. This parameter controls what information is included in the cutout. The new default is `image`, which includes only the image pixels in the cutout.
