### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Add new `CUTOUTDETAIL` parameter that can be set to `Image`, `MaskedImage`, or `Exposure`, where `Exposure` provides the previous behavior. This parameter controls what information is included in the cutout. The new default is `Image`, which includes only the image pixels in the cutout.
